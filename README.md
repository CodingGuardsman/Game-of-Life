# Game of Life
#### Video Demo:  <(https://youtu.be/sRyYqqGXM50)>
#### Description:
This repository serves as the repository for the implementation of Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The Game of Life simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules, leading to fascinating emergent behaviors.

# Key Features:

## Interactive Simulation:
Users can engage in an interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life, observing the dynamic evolution of cell states over successive generations.

## Customizable Initial Configurations:
Users have the flexibility to define custom initial configurations or select from a range of predefined patterns to kickstart the simulation.

## Step-by-Step Iteration:
Users can advance the simulation one step at a time, facilitating detailed observation of each generation's progression.

## Automated Evolution:
The simulation offers the option for automated evolution, allowing users to sit back and witness the continuous evolution of the cellular grid.

## Usage: Run python game_of_life.py to start the simulation.
