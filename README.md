Description:
This repository serves as the repository for the implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The Game of Life simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules, leading to fascinating emergent behaviors.

Key Features:

Interactive Simulation: Users can engage in an interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life, observing the dynamic evolution of cell states over successive generations.
Customizable Initial Configurations: Users have the flexibility to define custom initial configurations or select from a range of predefined patterns to kickstart the simulation.
Step-by-Step Iteration: Users can advance the simulation one step at a time, facilitating detailed observation of each generation's progression.
Automated Evolution: The simulation offers the option for automated evolution, allowing users to sit back and witness the continuous evolution of the cellular grid.
